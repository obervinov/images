# Smartctl Exporter Docker Image for multi-architecture

- **Image Description**: This image contains a Smartctl Exporter application that provides a monitoring solution for hard drives and SSDs. The Smartctl Exporter application uses the smartctl command-line utility to gather SMART data from storage devices and exposes it in a format that can be consumed by Prometheus. This allows users to monitor the health and performance of their storage devices in real-time.
